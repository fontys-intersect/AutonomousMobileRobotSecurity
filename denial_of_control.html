    <h1>Tactic: Impact</h1>

    <h2>Technique: Denial Of Control</h2>
    Denial of control is an attack that can cause the rightful operators of the autonomous robot to lose control over
    the robot. This technique is most useful to an attacker when combined with control logic tampering, so that the
    attacker can control the robot themselves while keeping control away from the original owner.

    <h2>Technique in practice</h2>

    <h2>Mitigations</h2>
    Out-of-band communication channels can be used to keep a backdoor to the robot, in case the rightful owner loses
    control. A redundancy of services can also be used as a backdoor, though this is more easily detectable by the
    attacker on the operating system level.

    <h2>Detections</h2>
    A simple health check service could detect whether the robot is still accessible.

    <h2>Documented incidents with autonomous robots</h2>
    No incidents known at the time of writing.
