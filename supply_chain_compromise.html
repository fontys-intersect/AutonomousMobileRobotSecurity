    <h1>Tactic: Initial Access</h1>

    <h2>Technique: Supply Chain Compromise</h2>
    Robots, like other machines with software, make excessive use of dependencies for its functionality. These
    dependencies can contain vulnerabilities. An attacker can focus its efforts on exploiting the vulnerable
    dependencies. An autonomous robot is not unique in this regard.

    <h2>Technique in practice</h2>

      attack?</a>

    <h2>Mitigations</h2>
    The developers of the autonomous robot should keep the used dependencies up-to-date, especially on security-critical
    updates. The user of the robot should regularly check for updates from the robot's manufacturer.

    <h2>Detections</h2>
    The toolchain used in development should do periodic scanning of its dependencies, and cross-reference these results
    with popular security databases. This automated process would notify the developers of vulnerabilities, and what
    version to update it to.

    <h2>Documented incidents with autonomous robots</h2>
    No incidents known at the time of writing.
