# Mobile Robot Security

This repo contains products related to Mobile Robots performed by Fontys ICT.

## Goal
Getting insight in Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) for attacking/testing mobile robots in the public space and finding ways to mitigate such attacks.

## Scope
To ensure the practical value of the results of the research, a specific subset of robots in a specific context has been chosen as research subject.
### Devices
According to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), a mobile robot is defined as:
”A mobile robot is a self-contained device that is capable of moving about in its environment and carrying out tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously, with its mobility being an essential part of its function.”
This definition can be found in the ISO standard ”ISO 8373:2012 Robots and robotic devices – Vocabulary”, which provides a comprehensive set of definitions and terms related to robotics. 
Autonomously driving cars are excluded from the scope.
### Context
The environment is accessable to the public, can be in- or outdoor, dynamic and unpredictable. 

### Results
- "Mitre Att&ck"-style matrix for attacking Mobile Robots.
- "Mitre D3fend"-style matrix for attacking Mobile Robots.
