    <h1>Tactic: Disturbance</h1>

    <h2>Technique: Software Power Off Or Reset</h2>

    Disabling the target robot is less dangerous than the attacker having total control over the robot, but can be an
    effective technique depending on the context nonetheless. Powering off the robot usually requires access to the
    operating system running on the robot itself. Using a simple "poweroff" command (or equivalent) is often enough, as
    this command is often not locked behind higher permissions. If it is, the attacker must first gain higher access
    through some form of privilege escalation.

    <h2>Mitigations</h2>
    Limiting the users who can initiate the shutdown protocol on the robot greatly reduces the attack surface. Ensuring
    that users with higher permissions can power off the robot will fully mitigate this attack, given that there is no
    privilege escalation exploit present.

    <h2>Detections</h2>
    The robot itself powering off is fairly obvious. One could have a health check service that pings the robot
    periodically to see if it is still available, and if not, it may have been powered off.

    <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
    Just as when physically powering off a robot, doing it via a software method can create a dangerous situation or do damage to it's surroundings. One should be aware of the consequences to the environment or others when a robot is turned of abruptly and when necessary take precautions.

    <h2>Documented incidents with autonomous robots</h2>
    During a pentest on the Jackal robot from Clear Path Robotics, admin access was granted by inputting default
    credentials through SSH. With admin permissions, the linux command "poweroff" was initiated, and the robot shut
    itself down. This also is the case with the Unitree as shown below.
