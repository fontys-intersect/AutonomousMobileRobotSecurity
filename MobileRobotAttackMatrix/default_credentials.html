    <h1>Tactic: Initial Access</h1>

    <h2>Technique: Default Credentials</h2>
    Standard protocols and services often come with default passwords set by the manufacturer of the robot*. If the owner
    of the robot does not change these default credentials, an attacker can try to access the machine by using these
    credentials, which are often publicly available.

    <h2>Technique in practice</h2>
    <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2022/03/16/attackers-using-default-credentials/">Article: attackers using
      default credentials to target businesses</a> <br>
    <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA13-175A">Article: risks of default passwords on the internet</a>
	<br>
	Vaak kunnen default credentials online gevonden worden.

    <h2>Mitigations</h2>
    The default password of any protocol that is publicly accessible should be changed to something unique. A strong
    password should be assigned to it instead. 
	A strong password usually has a minimal character limit of atleast 8, atleast one uppercase, one number and a special character.
	This increases the amount of characters to check for every position and makes password cracking take a lot longer.

    <h2>Detections</h2>
    It is very hard to detect unlawful access through default credentials, since the traffic looks exactly the same as
    lawful access. It is best not to try and detect this technique, but instead to always apply the mitigation, since it
    has no costs except implementation.

    If any detection method is to be applied, the defender can monitor logon sessions for default credentials to log
    what machines have accessed the robot.

    <h2>Documented incidents with autonomous robots</h2>
    During a pentest on a Jackal robot from Clear Path Robotics, default administrator credentials were pulled from the
    internet. The credentials on the robot were not changed by its owners, and the default credentials granted admin
    access on the machine.
