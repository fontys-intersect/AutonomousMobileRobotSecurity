    <h1>Tactic: Impact</h1>

    <h2>Technique: Denial Of Availability</h2>
    Once an attacker has (sufficient) access to the autonomous robot, it could use any number of techniques from the
    "disturbance" tactic to ensure that the robot is not available anymore. This is similar to a denial of service
    attack, but in a denial of availability attack, the entire machine becomes unresponsive, instead of just a single
    service.

    <h2>Technique in practice</h2>

    <h2>Mitigations</h2>
    The mitigation techniques discussed in the "disturbance" tactic should be considered most. The techniques described
    in said tactic are most likely to cause a denial of availability.

    <h2>Detections</h2>
    A simple health check service could detect whether the robot is still accessible.

    <h2>Documented incidents with autonomous robots</h2>
    No incidents known at the time of writing.
