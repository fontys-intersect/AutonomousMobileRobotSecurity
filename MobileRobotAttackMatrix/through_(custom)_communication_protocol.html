        <h1>Tactic: Lateral Movement</h1>

        <h2>Technique: Through (Custom) Communication Protocol</h2>

        Autonomous robots often have many different components with different layers of software running on it. Some of these components might be able to communicate through a (custom) communication protocol. An adversary can attempt to control these different components through this protocol, resulting in lateral movement.

        <h2>Technique in practice</h2>
        <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/lateral-movement/">Article: lateral movement</a>

        <h2>Mitigations</h2>
        If communication via this protocol is not strictly necessary it could be disabled.

        <h2>Detections</h2>
        Monitoring software could check if communication from a particular source is authorized.

        <h2>Documented incidents with autonomous robots</h2>
        Here a Unitree GO1 is seen being controlled via MQTT:
