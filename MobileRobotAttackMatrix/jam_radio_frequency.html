    <h1>Tactic: Disturbance</h1>

    <h2>Technique: Jam Radio Frequency</h2>

    When a robot uses wireless transmission protocols for remote control, these radio frequencies can be disturbed by
    using a technique called radio jamming. In general this is done by generating a lot radio noise on a specific
    frequency using a powerful transmitter.
    An example of jamming can sometimes be seen when one uses a microwave close to a WiFi network. Because a microwave
    oven and WiFi work on the same frequency, the radio signals generated by the microwave can cause connection issues
    with WiFi devices. All the random noise makes it difficult or impossible for devices to filter out the real network
    traffic.
    Radio signals are difficult to target in a specific direction. Because of this, using this technique can disturb
    multiple devices within the environment.

    <h2>Technique in practice</h2>

    <h2>Mitigations</h2>
    It is difficult to protect against jamming attacks in an open environment. Radio waves can penetrate through windows
    and walls when the transmitter is powerful enough. It is possible though to protect closed environments like
    buildings by using thick walls or working within a Faraday Cage. Using a broader range of frequencies for control or
    as fallback channels can protect against jamming attacks on a single frequency.

    <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
    Jamming radio frequencies can disrupt devices and services in the surrounding environment. Most countries have very
    strict laws and regulations regarding jamming and one should be aware of these before using this tactic. Just like
    an EMP, jamming radio frequencies, especially when jamming a wide range of frequencies, can lead to situations that
    can put others in danger or lead to financial damages.
