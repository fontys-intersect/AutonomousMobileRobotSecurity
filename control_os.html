        <h1>Tactic: Impact</h1>

        <h2>Technique: Control OS</h2>

        Once adversaries have gained control over a system and escalated their permissions, they could take over control of the operating system. This would implicate that the user no longer has control of the operating system.</br>
		A user would not be able to use their machine and adversaries could do anything they want. As a end user it is very hard to regain control of the system without a full software reset.

        <h2>Technique in practice</h2>
        The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) reported a targeted attack on a steel mill in its <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/Securitysituation/IT-Security-Situation-in-Germany-2014.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3">2014 IT Security Report</a>. These targeted attacks affected industrial operations and resulted in breakdowns of control system components and even entire installations. As a result of these breakdowns, massive impact resulted in damage and unsafe conditions from the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace.

        <h2>Mitigations</h2>
        There are several ways to minimize damage. One of the most common ways is to create backups on a regular basis. This way the operating system can be rolled back to the latest uninfected version.</br>
		Another option is to have redundant systems. When one system has been compromised, the other could take over.

        <h2>Documented incidents with autonomous robots</h2>
        No incidents known at the time of writing.

        <h2>Documented incidents in other domains</h2>
