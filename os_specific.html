    <h1>Tactic: Persistence</h1>

    <h2>Technique: OS Specific</h2>
    Each operating system has their own set of standards and protocols that define how system startup should behave. These OS specific methods can be leveraged to implement persistence of malware and/or backdoors for the attacker to install and consistently apply.

    <h2>Technique in practice</h2>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImGaqVHAbCk">Video: persistence mechanisms</a>

    <h2>Mitigations</h2>
    Startup mechanisms should be restricted to user accounts with higher privileges.

    <h2>Detections</h2>
    Virusscanners can often detect the installation of malicious payloads and malware.

    <h2>Documented incidents with autonomous robots</h2>
    No incidents known at the time of writing.
