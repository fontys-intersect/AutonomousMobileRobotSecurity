        <h2>Technique: Compromise Controller</h2>

        Compromising the robots controller is a effective way of gaining control over the robot. This can be done in a few ways: <br>
		- Recording and replaying the commands that the controller sends to the robot. <br>
		- Hacking the controller itself by overwriting certain parts of the code used in the controller. <br>
		- DOS'ing the controller communication to the robot. This will cause the robot to not respond to the operator. <br>
		- Having the same controller sending commands at the same time blocking or even breaking the robots communication.
		

        <h2>Technique in practice</h2>

        <h2>Mitigations</h2>
        As for mitifations a few additions in the robots security can fix these issues: <br>
		- Sending ID's or keys with each command send so the robot can verify and check if the command is a new one and authorized to send this command. <br>
		- Keeping the controller in a safe location. <br>
		- Make it possible to interact with the robot in multiple ways to minimize the DOS attack risk and making it return upon encountering loss of communication. <br>
		- Pair a controller to the robot is a safe way to make sure the same type of controller cant control the robot you are using.

        <h2>Detections</h2>
        Detecting the multiple ways a controller can be compromised depends on the attack: <br>
		- With the ID system in place for messaging between the controller and robot, it is easy to detect fake or forged commands. <br>
		- Loss of communication is a sure tell way of detecting a DOS attack. <br>
		- Having the controller be paired to the robot makes detecting a roque controller easier as it does not have authorized permission to command the robot.
