    <h1>Tactic: Impact</h1>

    <h2>Technique: Software Factory Reset</h2>
    An attacker can perform a software factory reset. Once all former traces of old code, files and programs have been wiped, combined with setting custom passwords for access, the attacker can ensure that the original owner of the robot does not have any means of accessing the robot anymore.

    <h2>Technique in practice</h2>

    <h2>Mitigations</h2>
    A software factory reset should be locked behind higher user priviliges within the robot's OS.

    <h2>Detections</h2>
    A simple health check service could detect whether the robot is still accessible.

    <h2>Documented incidents with autonomous robots</h2>
    No incidents known at the time of writing.
